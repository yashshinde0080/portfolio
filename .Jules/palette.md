## 2024-05-23 - External Links Accessibility
**Learning:** External links often lack visual cues and screen reader announcements, leaving users unsure if they will leave the current site.
**Action:** Always add an `ExternalLink` icon and `aria-label` text (e.g., "(opens in a new tab)") to links with `target="_blank"`.
